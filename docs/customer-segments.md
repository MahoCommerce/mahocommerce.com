2. **Click** "Add Segment"
3. **Configure** basic settings:
   - **Name**: Descriptive segment name
   - **Description**: Internal notes
   - **Status**: Active/Inactive
   - **Websites**: Scope segment to specific websites
   - **Refresh Mode**: Auto (scheduled) or Manual

4. **Build conditions** in the "Conditions" tab:

   - Nest conditions using Combine for complex logic

5. **Optional**: Configure email automation:
   - Enable "Auto Email Active"
   - Choose trigger: Enter or Exit segment
   - Configure email sequence (see [Email Automation](email-automation.md))

6. **Save** the segment

### Refreshing Segments

Segments can be refreshed manually or automatically:

**Manual Refresh**:
- Click "Refresh Segment" in segment edit screen
- Forces immediate recalculation of membership

**Automatic Refresh**:
- Set "Refresh Mode" to "Auto"
- Runs daily via cron at 5 AM (default)
- Configure schedule in `customer/customer_segments/cron_schedule`

**Refresh Status**:
- **Pending**: Waiting to be refreshed
- **Processing**: Currently refreshing
- **Completed**: Successfully refreshed
- **Error**: Refresh failed (check logs)

### Using Segments in Sales Rules

1. **Navigate** to **Promotions → Shopping Cart Price Rules**
2. **Create** or edit a price rule
3. **In Conditions tab**, add condition:
   - **Customer Segment → Matches**: Select your segment(s)
4. **Configure** discount and other rule details
5. **Save** the rule

**Example**: VIP-Only 20% Discount
```
Name: VIP Platinum - 20% Off
Conditions:
- Customer Segment: matches "VIP Platinum Tier"
Actions:
- Apply: 20% discount on entire cart
- Free Shipping: Yes
```

## Performance & Optimization

### Segment Refresh Performance

Large segments can take time to refresh:

- **Small** (< 1,000 customers): < 1 second
- **Medium** (1,000-10,000): 1-5 seconds
- **Large** (10,000-100,000): 5-30 seconds
- **Very Large** (100,000+): 30 seconds - 2 minutes

**Optimization Tips**:
- Use indexed fields when possible (customer_id, email, created_at)
- Avoid overly complex nested conditions
- Refresh during off-peak hours
- Consider manual refresh for rarely-used segments

### Database Indexing

Critical indexes for segment performance:

```sql
-- Customer table
CREATE INDEX idx_created_at ON customer_entity(created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_email ON customer_entity(email);

-- Order table
CREATE INDEX idx_customer_id ON sales_flat_order(customer_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_created_at ON sales_flat_order(created_at);

-- Cart table
CREATE INDEX idx_customer_id ON sales_flat_quote(customer_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_updated_at ON sales_flat_quote(updated_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_is_active ON sales_flat_quote(is_active);
```

### Caching

Segment results are cached in `customer_segment_customer` table:

- Membership persists between refreshes
- Fast lookup for sales rules and email triggers
- Invalidated only on segment refresh

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Segment Metrics

Each segment displays key metrics:

- **Matched Customers**: Current segment size
- **Last Refresh**: When segment was last updated
- **Refresh Status**: Current processing status
- **Created At**: Segment creation date
- **Priority**: For overlapping segment resolution

### Viewing Segment Members

To see which customers are in a segment:

1. **Option A - Admin Grid**:
   - Customer grid → Filter by segment
   - Shows all customers in selected segment

2. **Option B - Database Query**:
```sql
SELECT c.entity_id, c.email, c.firstname, c.lastname
FROM customer_entity c
JOIN customer_segment_customer sc ON c.entity_id = sc.customer_id
WHERE sc.segment_id = 1;  -- Your segment ID
```

3. **Option C - Export**:
   - Use Maho export functionality
   - Filter by segment before export

### Performance Monitoring

Monitor segment refresh performance in logs:

**Location**: `var/log/customer_segmentation.log`

```
2025-10-21 05:00:00 INFO: Refreshing segment: VIP Platinum (ID: 1)
2025-10-21 05:00:02 INFO: Segment 1 refreshed successfully. Time: 1.82s, Memory: 12.5MB, Customers: 342
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Segment Design

**Do**:
- Use descriptive names ("Cart Abandoned $200+" vs "Segment 1")
- Add detailed descriptions for team reference
- Test conditions on a few customers first
- Start simple, add complexity as needed

**Don't**:
- Create overlapping segments unless intentional
- Use overly broad conditions (entire customer base)
- Neglect to document segment purpose

### 2. Refresh Strategy

**For Real-Time Needs**:
- Use manual refresh mode
- Trigger via API or admin action
- Best for time-sensitive campaigns

**For Scheduled Campaigns**:
- Use auto refresh mode
- Leverage daily cron job
- Best for ongoing automation

### 3. Condition Building

**Efficient Conditions**:
- Use indexed fields (email, customer_id, dates)
- Avoid string pattern matching on large datasets
- Combine related conditions logically

**Inefficient Conditions**:
- `LIKE '%pattern%'` on large text fields
- Overly nested combine conditions (>3 levels)
- Cartesian product conditions

### 4. Email Automation Integration

**When to Automate**:
- Transactional sequences (cart abandonment, welcome)
- Time-sensitive offers (birthday, win-back)
- Behavioral triggers (browse abandonment)

**When to Manual Send**:
- One-time campaigns
- A/B testing templates
- Unproven segment performance

### 5. Sales Rule Usage

**Combine Segments with Other Conditions**:
```
Conditions (ALL):
- Customer Segment: matches "VIP Tier"
- Cart Subtotal: greater than $100
- Shipping Country: equals "US"
```

**Use Priority for Overlapping Rules**:
- Higher priority segments get precedence
- Prevent discount stacking issues

## Troubleshooting

### Segment Not Matching Expected Customers

**Check**:
1. ✅ All conditions are configured correctly
2. ✅ Operators match intent (equals vs. greater than)
3. ✅ Segment has been refreshed recently
4. ✅ Website scope is correct
5. ✅ Test with a specific customer ID manually

**Debug Query**:
```sql
-- Check segment conditions
SELECT conditions_serialized FROM customer_segment WHERE segment_id = 1;

-- Check matched customers
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customer_segment_customer WHERE segment_id = 1;
```

### Segment Refresh Failing

**Common Causes**:
- Invalid SQL in complex conditions
- Missing required data (deleted products, etc.)
- Database connection issues
- Memory limit exceeded for very large segments

**Check Logs**:
```bash
tail -f var/log/customer_segmentation.log
tail -f var/log/exception.log
```

### Performance Issues

**Symptoms**:
- Segment refresh takes >5 minutes
- Admin panel slow when viewing segments
- Cron jobs timing out

**Solutions**:
1. **Add database indexes** (see Performance section)
2. **Simplify conditions** (reduce nesting)
3. **Increase PHP memory** (`php.ini`: `memory_limit = 512M`)
4. **Run refresh manually** during off-peak hours

## Advanced Usage

### Programmatic Segment Membership Check

```php
$customerId = 123;
$segmentId = 1;
$websiteId = 1;

$isInSegment = Mage::getResourceModel('customersegmentation/segment')
    ->isCustomerInSegment($segmentId, $customerId, $websiteId);

if ($isInSegment) {
    // Customer is in segment
}
```

### Real-Time Segment Evaluation

For real-time checking without refresh:

```php
$segment = Mage::getModel('customersegmentation/segment')->load($segmentId);
$customer = Mage::getModel('customer/customer')->load($customerId);

if ($segment->validateCustomer($customer, $websiteId)) {
    // Customer matches segment conditions right now
}
```

### Bulk Segment Export

Export all segment members:

```php
$segment = Mage::getModel('customersegmentation/segment')->load($segmentId);
$customerIds = $segment->getMatchingCustomerIds();

foreach ($customerIds as $customerId) {
    $customer = Mage::getModel('customer/customer')->load($customerId);
    // Process customer
}
```

## Migration from Other Platforms

### From Magento 1 Enterprise

Maho's segmentation is based on (and compatible with) Magento 1 Enterprise Edition:

- **Conditions**: Nearly identical condition types
- **Database schema**: Compatible structure
- **Export/Import**: Can migrate segment configurations
- **Enhancements**: Email automation is new in Maho

**Migration Steps**:
1. Export segment conditions from M1EE
2. Recreate segments in Maho admin
3. Test conditions with sample customers
4. Enable and configure email automation (new feature)

### From Magento 2

Magento 2 has similar segmentation:

- **Concept mapping**: M2 segments → Maho segments
- **Conditions**: Similar but syntax differs
- **Rebuild required**: Manual recreation needed
- **Test thoroughly**: Condition logic may differ

## Integration Points

### REST API (Future)

Programmatic segment management (planned):

```php
// Future API endpoint
GET    /api/rest/segments
POST   /api/rest/segments
PUT    /api/rest/segments/:id
DELETE /api/rest/segments/:id
POST   /api/rest/segments/:id/refresh
GET    /api/rest/segments/:id/customers
```

### External CRM Sync

Sync segment membership to external CRM:

```php
// Custom observer example
public function syncSegmentToCrm(Varien_Event_Observer $observer)
{
    $segment = $observer->getSegment();
    $customerIds = $observer->getMatchedCustomers();

    // Push to your CRM
    $this->crmClient->updateSegment($segment->getName(), $customerIds);
}
```
