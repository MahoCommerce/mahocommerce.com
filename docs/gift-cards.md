#### Order View Page (Sales > Orders > View Order)

When viewing an order that was paid with gift cards, you'll see:

- **Order Totals Section**: Gift card discount line showing the applied amount
  ```
  Subtotal:                    $175.00
  Shipping & Handling:          $10.00
  Tax:                          $15.00
  Gift Card (GC-XX...XXXX):    -$50.00
  ─────────────────────────────────────
  Grand Total:                 $150.00
  ```

- **Payment Information Section**: Lists the applied gift card codes with amounts
- Multiple gift cards are shown individually if more than one was used

#### Invoice View

Invoices display the gift card amount in the totals section, showing how much of the invoice was covered by gift cards.

#### Credit Memo View

Credit memos show:
- The proportional gift card refund amount in the totals
- "Refund to Gift Card" field when creating the credit memo

### Invoice Processing

When creating an invoice for an order with gift cards:

- Gift card purchases: New gift cards are generated when the invoice is paid
- Gift card payments: The applied amount is shown in invoice totals

### Credit Memo Processing

When creating a credit memo:

#### Orders Paid Partially with Gift Cards
- Refund is proportionally distributed between gift card and other payment methods
- Gift card balance is restored for the gift card portion

#### Orders Fully Paid with Gift Cards
- Enter the refund amount in the **Refund to Gift Card** field
- Amount is added back to the customer's gift card balance
- Gift card status changes from "Used" back to "Active" if applicable

#### Expiration Handling on Refunds
When refunding to a gift card, the system automatically extends the expiration date if needed:

- If the gift card is **expired** or will expire within the configured extension period, the expiration is extended
- The extension ensures the customer has at least the configured number of days (default: 30) to use the refunded balance
- Gift cards with more time remaining than the extension period keep their original expiration date
- The extension is recorded in the gift card history for audit purposes

!!! example "Example"
    A gift card expires in 10 days. The "Refund Expiration Extension" is set to 30 days. When a refund is processed:

    - The balance is restored to the gift card
    - The expiration is extended to 30 days from now (not just 10)
    - History records: "Refund for order #123 (expiration extended to 30 days from now)"

```

│  Grand Total:                 $100.00   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Order Cancellation

When an order paid with gift cards is canceled:

- Gift card balance is automatically restored for the full amount
- Gift card status changes from "Used" back to "Active" (if applicable)
- Expiration handling follows the same rules as credit memo refunds:
  - If the gift card is expired or will expire within the configured extension period, the expiration is extended
  - The extension ensures the customer has at least the configured number of days (default: 30) to use the restored balance
  - Gift cards with more time remaining keep their original expiration date
- History entry is created documenting the cancellation and any expiration extension

!!! note "Automatic Refund"
    Gift card refunds on order cancellation are automatic. There's no need to create a credit memo - the balance is restored immediately when the order is canceled.

### Admin Order Creation

When creating orders in the admin panel:

1. Add products to the order
2. In the **Gift Card** section, enter a code and click **Apply**
3. Gift card discount appears in order totals
4. Complete the order with remaining balance via other payment method

## Multi-Store and Multi-Currency

### Website Binding

- Each gift card is permanently assigned to one website at creation
- Gift cards can only be redeemed on their assigned website
- This prevents cross-website balance exploitation

### Currency Handling

Gift cards support multi-currency environments:

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| **Storage** | Balances stored in website's base currency |
| **Display** | Converted to store view currency for display |
| **Redemption** | Converted using current exchange rates |
| **Refunds** | Returned in base currency |

**Example:**

- Gift card created on US website: $100.00 USD (base currency)
- Viewed in UK store view: £79.00 GBP (at current exchange rate)
- Customer redeems £50.00 GBP worth
- Balance reduced by equivalent USD amount
- Remaining balance: ~$37.00 USD

!!! tip "Exchange Rates"
    Ensure your currency exchange rates are up to date for accurate gift card conversions across currencies.

## Barcode Support

The module supports Code128 barcodes when the optional barcode library is installed.

### Installation

Add the barcode package to your project:

```bash
composer require picqer/php-barcode-generator
```

### Configuration

1. Enable barcodes in **System > Configuration > Sales > Gift Cards > Show Barcode**
2. Barcodes will appear on gift cards in emails and PDFs

!!! note "Library Detection"
    The module automatically detects if the barcode library is installed. If not installed, the barcode option is hidden in configuration.

## Gift Card Lifecycle

Understanding how gift cards move through different states:

### Statuses

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Active** | Can be used for purchases |
| **Used** | Balance is zero, fully consumed |
| **Expired** | Past expiration date, no longer valid |
| **Disabled** | Manually disabled by admin |

### Lifecycle Flow

```
Purchase → Invoice Paid → Gift Card Created (Active)
                              ↓
                    Customer Redeems (partial)
                              ↓
                    Balance Reduced (still Active)
                              ↓
              ┌───────────────┴───────────────┐
              ↓                               ↓
    Fully Redeemed (Used)           Expires (Expired)
              ↓
    Credit Memo → Refund (Active again)
```

### Automatic Expiration

A daily cron job (runs at 1 AM) automatically:

- Finds all active gift cards past their expiration date
- Changes their status to "Expired"
- Records the expiration in history

## Troubleshooting

### Gift Card Not Applying

**Problem:** Customer cannot apply a gift card code.

**Possible causes:**

- Code is incorrect or has typos
- Gift card is assigned to a different website
- Gift card status is not "Active"
- Gift card has expired
- Gift card balance is zero
- Cart contains only gift card products (circular purchase prevention)

**Solution:** Check the gift card in admin to verify status, website, balance, and expiration.

### Gift Cards Not Created After Purchase

**Problem:** Customer purchased gift cards but codes weren't generated.

**Possible causes:**

- Order not yet invoiced
- Invoice not yet paid
- Cron jobs not running

**Solution:**

1. Verify the order has been invoiced
2. Check invoice payment status
3. Verify cron is running: `./maho cron:run`

### Emails Not Sending

**Problem:** Gift card notification emails are not being delivered.

**Possible causes:**

- No recipient email on gift card
- Email scheduled for future delivery
- Email queue not processing
- SMTP configuration issues

**Solution:**

1. Check gift card has recipient email set
2. Check `email_scheduled_at` vs `email_sent_at` timestamps
3. Verify email cron job is running (every 5 minutes)
4. Check email logs for delivery errors

### Balance Conversion Issues

**Problem:** Gift card balance appears incorrect in different currencies.

**Possible causes:**

- Exchange rates not configured
- Exchange rates out of date

**Solution:**

1. Go to **System > Currency > Rates**
2. Import current exchange rates
3. Verify rates are correct for your currencies

### Gift Card Discount Not Applying

**Problem:** Gift card discount doesn't appear in order totals.

**Possible causes:**

- Gift card code not applied correctly
- Gift card module disabled
- Gift card assigned to different website

**Solution:**

1. Verify the gift card code was successfully applied in cart or checkout
2. Check that applied gift cards appear in the order totals section
3. For full coverage orders (≤ $0.01 remaining), the "Free" payment method should be available
4. Verify the gift card module is enabled in configuration

## Best Practices

### Security

- **Never display full codes** in admin grids or customer-facing areas (use masked display)
- **Enable rate limiting** to prevent code enumeration attacks
- **Regularly audit** gift card history for suspicious activity
- **Set reasonable expiration dates** to manage liability

### Operations

- **Monitor breakage** (unused balances) as a business metric
- **Set up alerts** for high-value gift card transactions
- **Regular reconciliation** of gift card balances vs. revenue
- **Document manual adjustments** with clear comments

### Customer Experience

- **Clear redemption instructions** in gift card emails
- **Balance visibility** on account dashboard
- **Multiple redemption options** (cart page, checkout, account)
- **Prompt delivery** of gift card emails
