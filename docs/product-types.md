# Product Types

Understanding product types is essential for setting up your catalog effectively. Maho offers seven product types, each designed for different selling scenarios. Choosing the right type ensures your customers have the best shopping experience and you can manage inventory efficiently.

## Quick Comparison

| Product Type | Physical Shipping | Has Variations | Sold Individually | Best For |
|--------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Simple** | Yes | No | Yes | Single items with no options |
| **Configurable** | Yes | Yes (one parent) | Via child products | Products with size, color, etc. |
| **Grouped** | Yes | Yes (collection) | Each item separate | Related items sold together |
| **Virtual** | No | No | Yes | Services, warranties |
| **Bundle** | Yes | Yes (customizable) | As a kit | Build-your-own kits |
| **Downloadable** | No | No | Yes | Digital files, software, media |
| **Gift Card** | No | No | Yes | Gift cards with email delivery |

## Simple Products

A Simple Product is the most basic and commonly used product type. It represents a single, physical item with no variations.

### When to Use

- The product has no options (no sizes, colors, or other choices)
- Each variation has its own SKU and should be listed separately
- You're selling books, single items, or products that don't need customization

### Real-World Examples

- A paperback book
- A coffee mug with a fixed design
- A pack of batteries
- A kitchen utensil
- A specific model of headphones (e.g., "Sony WH-1000XM5 - Black")

### Key Characteristics

- Has its own SKU and inventory count
- Can have custom options (like engraving text) but not configurable variations
- Straightforward to set up and manage
- Shows directly in search and category listings

## Configurable Products

A Configurable Product allows customers to choose from a set of variations (like size and color) before adding to cart. Behind the scenes, each variation is actually a Simple Product linked to a parent Configurable Product.

### When to Use

- The product comes in multiple variations (size, color, material, etc.)
- You want one product page where customers select their options
- Each variation has different inventory levels or SKUs
- You want a cleaner catalog without listing every variation separately

### Real-World Examples

- A t-shirt available in S, M, L, XL and in 5 colors
- Running shoes in different sizes
- A laptop with different RAM and storage configurations
- A phone case available in multiple colors
- Furniture available in different fabrics or finishes

### Key Characteristics

- Parent product is not sold directly (it's a container)
- Each variation (child) is a Simple Product with its own SKU and stock
- Customers select options using dropdowns or swatches on the product page
- Price can vary by option (e.g., larger size costs more)
- Only one unit is added to cart at a time

### Configurable vs. Simple with Custom Options

| Scenario | Use Configurable | Use Simple + Custom Options |
|----------|------------------|----------------------------|
| Need separate inventory per option | ✅ | ❌ |
| Price varies significantly by option | ✅ | ✅ (with price modifiers) |
| Options don't affect inventory | ❌ | ✅ |
| Example: Shirt sizes | ✅ | ❌ |
| Example: Gift wrap yes/no | ❌ | ✅ |

---

## Grouped Products

A Grouped Product displays multiple related Simple Products together on one page. Unlike Configurable Products, each item in a group is purchased separately with its own quantity.

### When to Use

- You're selling related items that are often bought together
- Customers should be able to choose quantities for each item
- Items can also be sold individually elsewhere in your store
- You want to showcase a collection without forcing bundle purchase

### Real-World Examples

- A furniture set (table + 4 chairs, each priced separately)
- A workout equipment collection (dumbbells, mat, resistance bands)
- A skincare routine set (cleanser, toner, moisturizer)
- Camera body shown with compatible lenses
- Wine collection (3 different bottles that complement each other)

### Key Characteristics

- Each item in the group is a Simple Product
- Customers enter quantity for each item (can choose 0 for items they don't want)
- Each item has its own price displayed
- Items can exist in the catalog independently
- No "parent" inventory - stock is tracked per individual item
- Great for cross-selling related products

### Grouped vs. Configurable

| Aspect | Grouped | Configurable |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| Customer selects | Quantity of each item | One option combination |
| Added to cart | Multiple line items | Single line item |
| Items sold separately | Yes, as Simple Products | Child products can be hidden |
| Use case | "Buy these together" | "Choose your options" |

## Virtual Products

A Virtual Product is a non-physical product that doesn't require shipping. It's perfect for services and intangible goods that aren't downloaded files.

### When to Use

- You're selling a service
- The product doesn't require shipping or download
- You need to track purchases of intangible items

## Bundle Products

A Bundle Product lets customers build their own product by choosing from a set of options. Think of it as "build your own kit" where some choices may be required and others optional.

### When to Use

- Customers should customize what's included in a package
- You want to offer a discount for buying items together
- Creating build-your-own or pick-and-choose products

- Inventory can track individual components or the bundle itself

### Bundle Options Types

| Option Type | Description | Example |

| **Radio Buttons** | Select one, displayed as buttons | Choose your size (S/M/L) |
| **Checkbox** | Select multiple | Add accessories (can pick several) |
| **Multi-Select** | Select multiple from dropdown | Choose included games |

### Bundle Pricing Options

### When to Use

### Download Links vs. Samples

| Type | Purpose | Access |
|------|---------|--------|
