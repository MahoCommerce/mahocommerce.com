<h1 id="homeh1"><span>Maho - </span>open on-premise ecommerce platform</h1>
<h2 id="homeh2">#StrongRoots #ForwardThinking #FamiliarYetDifferent</h2>

**Maho** is a free and **open source ecommerce platform**, created in 2024 by
[a former maintainer of OpenMage](https://fabrizioballiano.com){:target="_blank"}.
Based on the M1 platform, Maho grants **hyper stability** and a **vast ecosystem of 
modules and extensions**.

**Maho's primary goals** are to propel this wonderful platform into the future, with **high performance,
new features, modern developer-friendly architecture, zero hassles and zero baggage**.

We will try to make Maho as backward compatible as possible, but we won't let the ghosts of the
past stop the innovation we need to bring to developers and store owners.
