# Search Engine Optimization

Maho includes a broad set of built-in SEO features: page metadata, canonical tags, clean URLs,
automatic crawl controls for layered navigation, XML sitemaps, and multi-store hreflang. This guide
walks through all of them and points you at the admin location for each.

Most settings live in three places under **System > Configuration**:

| Area | Location | What it controls |
|---|---|---|
| **Catalog SEO** | Catalog > Search Engine Optimizations | URLs, canonical tags, layered-navigation crawl controls, HTML sitemap |
| **HTML Head** | General > Design > HTML Head | Global default title, description, keywords, and robots |
| **XML Sitemap** | Catalog > Google Sitemap | Automated XML sitemap generation |

For file-level crawler directives (blocking whole paths, crawl delay, sitemap location), see the
dedicated [robots.txt](../hosting/robotstxt.md) page.

## Page metadata

### Global defaults

Under **Design > HTML Head** you set the store-wide fallbacks used when a page does not provide its
own values:

- **Default Title**, **Title Prefix**, **Title Suffix** - the title shell wrapped around each page title.
- **Default Description** and **Default Keywords** - used when a page has none of its own.
- **Default Robots** - the store-wide robots directive (for example `INDEX,FOLLOW`) applied when no
  more specific rule exists.

The **Page Title Separator** (under Catalog > Search Engine Optimizations) is the character used to
join the title parts, `-` by default.

### Per-page metadata

Products, categories, and CMS pages each have their own **meta title**, **meta description**,
**meta keywords**, and **meta robots** fields, set on the SEO section of their admin edit screens.
The per-entity `meta_robots` field accepts directives such as `INDEX,FOLLOW` or `NOINDEX,FOLLOW`
and lets you override indexing on a single product, category, or page.

### How the robots directive is resolved

For any frontend page, Maho resolves the meta robots tag through a fallback chain, using the first
value it finds:

1. The current **product's** meta robots (on a product page)
2. The current **category's** meta robots (on a category page)
3. The current **CMS page's** meta robots (on a CMS page)
4. The store's **Default Robots** setting

The layered-navigation controls below sit on top of this chain for category pages.

## Canonical tags

A canonical tag tells search engines which URL is the "official" version of a page, consolidating
ranking signals onto it.

| Setting | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| **Use Canonical Link Meta Tag For Categories** | Enabled | Category pages advertise their clean URL (no filter or page parameters) as the canonical version. |
| **Use Canonical Link Meta Tag For Products** | Disabled | Product pages advertise a canonical URL that ignores category context. Off by default, since the right product canonical strategy depends on how you use category paths in URLs. |

!!! note "Changed default in v26.7"
    The category canonical tag now defaults to **enabled** (it was previously off). Fresh installs
    get clean category canonicals out of the box. If you are upgrading and deliberately kept it off,
    review this setting after the update.

## Layered navigation crawl controls <span class="version-badge">v26.7+</span>

Category pages with layered navigation are a classic SEO trap. A single category can generate a
near-infinite number of URLs as visitors combine filters (color, size, price, brand) and walk
through pagination, wasting crawl budget and creating duplicate content that competes against your
real category page. Maho manages this automatically with three options, all **enabled by default**.

### Add NOINDEX,FOLLOW to Filtered Layered Navigation Pages

When a visitor applies one or more layered-navigation filters, the resulting page is marked
`NOINDEX,FOLLOW`. Search engines are told not to index the filtered view (avoiding duplicate
content), but they still **follow** the links on it, so your products keep getting discovered.

### Add NOINDEX,FOLLOW to Paginated Category Pages

Pages beyond the first (`?p=2` and onward) are marked `NOINDEX,FOLLOW`. The first page of a
category stays indexable as the canonical entry point, while thin "page 2, 3, 4..." views are kept
out of the index without blocking crawlers from walking through them.

### Add rel="nofollow" to Layered Navigation Filter Links

Filter links in the layered-navigation block carry `rel="nofollow"`, signaling to crawlers that
filter-combination URLs are not worth prioritizing. This reduces wasted crawl budget at the
source, before a crawler even requests the filtered URL.

### How Maho decides

The robots directive for a category view follows a clear order of precedence:

1. **An explicit category `noindex` always wins.** If you set the category's meta robots field to a
   value containing `noindex`, that directive is respected everywhere and the canonical tag is
   suppressed for that page. The admin's intent is never weakened.
2. **Filtered and paginated views are noindexed as duplicates**, even when the category itself is
   explicitly indexable, as long as the matching option above is enabled.
3. **Otherwise the page is indexable** and renders the category's own robots value plus its
   canonical tag.

!!! info "noindex and canonical are mutually exclusive"
    Maho never emits both a `noindex` directive and a cross-URL canonical on the same page. The two
    are contradictory (telling crawlers to drop this page while pointing them at a different
    canonical can deindex the canonical target), so a noindexed view never advertises a canonical.

Filter detection reads directly from the request, so it does not depend on render order, and
pagination detection uses the catalog toolbar's configured page parameter, so it keeps working even
if you customize the toolbar.

## URL structure

Clean, stable URLs are a core part of SEO. The Catalog > Search Engine Optimizations group controls
how catalog URLs are built:

- **Product URL Suffix** / **Category URL Suffix** - an optional suffix such as `.html` appended to
  product and category URLs. Leave blank for extensionless URLs.
- **Use Categories Path for Product URLs** - when enabled, product URLs include the category path
  (`/men/jackets/product-name`) instead of a bare product slug.
- **Create Permanent Redirect for URLs if URL Key Changed** (`save_rewrites_history`) - when a
  product or category URL key changes, Maho automatically creates a permanent **301 redirect** from
  the old URL to the new one, preserving link equity and avoiding broken links.

URL rewrites are stored in the `core_url_rewrite` table, and you can add custom rewrites and
redirects there as well.

## Multi-store hreflang

When a website has more than one active store view, Maho automatically emits
`<link rel="alternate" hreflang="...">` tags pointing to the equivalent URL in each other store
view, based on each store's locale. This tells search engines which language/region version to
serve and prevents the variants from being treated as duplicate content. No configuration is
required: the tags appear automatically once a second active store view exists and the matching URL
rewrite is present.

## XML sitemap

The **Google Sitemap** module (Catalog > Google Sitemap) generates standards-compliant XML
sitemaps covering your **categories**, **products**, and **CMS pages**. Key capabilities:

- **Per-entity settings**: change frequency, priority, and a `lastmod` timestamp configurable
  separately for categories, products, and CMS pages.
- **Image extension**: product and category images can be included as `<image:image>` entries to
  help image search.
- **Automatic file splitting**: when a sitemap exceeds the configured maximum URLs per file
  (50,000 by default), Maho splits it into multiple files and generates a sitemap index.
- **Scheduled generation**: a cron job regenerates the sitemap on a configurable frequency and can
  email a recipient if generation fails.

Once generated, reference the sitemap file from your [robots.txt](../hosting/robotstxt.md) so crawlers can
find it.

## HTML sitemap and search terms

Two additional options in the Catalog > Search Engine Optimizations group:

- **Autogenerated Site Map** - a human-friendly HTML sitemap listing categories and products,
  served under `/catalog/seo_sitemap/category` and `/catalog/seo_sitemap/product`.
- **Popular Search Terms** - exposes popular on-site search terms as crawlable links.

## Pages Maho keeps out of the index

Some pages should never be indexed, and Maho marks them `noindex, nofollow` out of the box:

- The entire **admin panel**, including the login, forgot-password, and reset-password screens.
- The **maintenance mode** page shown while the store is offline.

You typically reinforce this in [robots.txt](../hosting/robotstxt.md) by disallowing checkout, customer
account, cart, and search paths.

## Recommended setup

For most stores the defaults are the right starting point:

- Category canonical tag: **enabled**
- NOINDEX filtered pages: **enabled**
- NOINDEX paginated pages: **enabled**
- NOFOLLOW filter links: **enabled**
- A populated **Default Robots**, **Default Title**, and **Default Description** under HTML Head
- XML sitemap generation **enabled** and referenced from `robots.txt`

The catalog SEO settings are configurable per **store view**, so multi-store and multi-language
setups can tune crawl behavior independently. Pair them with a tailored [robots.txt](../hosting/robotstxt.md)
for complete control over how search engines crawl and index your catalog.
