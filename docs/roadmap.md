We think that it's extremely important, both for the team and the users, to have a clear and public roadmap.
That's why we manage it through github projets.

## Make it your own

There's no open source without the community, if you have ideas for improvements or new features, 
we encourage you to share them. You can post your ideas in the Ideas section of our GitHub Discussions:
