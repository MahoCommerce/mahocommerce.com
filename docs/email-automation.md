## Key Features

### Dynamic Coupon Generation

Each customer receives a unique, trackable coupon code:

- **Custom prefixes**: Brand your coupons (e.g., `CART`, `VIP`, `BDAY`)
- **Configurable expiration**: Create urgency with time-limited offers
- **One-time use**: Prevent coupon sharing
- **Sales rule integration**: Leverage existing discount rules

Example coupon codes:
```
CART12345ABC      # Cart abandonment for customer #1
BDAY67890DEF      # Birthday offer for customer #6
VIP11223GHI       # VIP exclusive for customer #11
```

### Intelligent Sequencing

Build sophisticated email journeys:

- **Flexible timing**: Delays from minutes to days
- **Progressive engagement**: Escalate offers over time
- **Exit handling**: Stop sequences when customers leave segments
- **Overlap control**: Prevent sequence conflicts

### Newsletter Integration

Respects customer preferences:

- **Subscription status**: Only sends to subscribed customers
- **Automatic cleanup**: Stops sequences on unsubscribe
- **Template system**: Uses Maho's newsletter template engine
- **Variable support**: Rich personalization options

## Configuration

### 1. Create Your Segment

Navigate to **Customers → Customer Segments → Add Segment**:

1. Set segment conditions (e.g., cart status, customer attributes)
2. Save the segment

### 2. Configure Email Sequences

The segment edit page has **two dedicated tabs** for email automation:

- **Enter Segment** tab - Configure sequences triggered when customers join the segment
- **Exit Segment** tab - Configure sequences triggered when customers leave the segment

This allows you to configure **both** enter and exit sequences for the same segment!

#### Adding Enter Sequences

In the **Enter Segment** tab:

1. Click "Add Email Step"
2. Select newsletter template
3. Set delay (in minutes)
4. Optionally enable coupon generation:
   - Choose sales rule
   - Set coupon prefix
   - Set expiration days
5. Save

Repeat for additional steps.

#### Adding Exit Sequences

In the **Exit Segment** tab:

Follow the same process as Enter sequences. Exit sequences are perfect for:
- Thank you emails when customers complete a purchase
- Win-back campaigns when high-value customers become inactive
- Feedback requests after issue resolution

### 3. Create Newsletter Templates

Create templates at **Newsletter → Newsletter Templates**:

Use available variables:

```html
<p>Hi {{var customer_firstname}},</p>

<p>Your cart is waiting! Complete your purchase with code:</p>
<p style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">{{var coupon_code}}</p>
<p>Save {{var coupon_discount_text}} - expires {{var coupon_expires_formatted}}</p>
```

See the [Email Template Variables reference](#email-template-variables) for all available variables.

### 4. Set Up Cron

Email automation requires cron to be configured:

```bash
# Email processing runs every 5 minutes
*/5 * * * * /path/to/maho cron:run customersegmentation_process_emails
```

Or rely on the main cron job:
```bash
*/5 * * * * /path/to/maho cron:run
```

## Monitoring & Analytics

### View Automation Stats

Each segment shows email automation statistics:

- **Total sequences started**: How many customers entered
- **Emails scheduled**: Pending emails
- **Emails sent**: Successfully delivered
- **Emails failed**: Delivery failures

### Sequence Progress Tracking

Track individual customer progress:

- **Status**: Scheduled, Sent, Failed, Skipped
- **Scheduled time**: When email will/was sent
- **Queue ID**: Link to newsletter queue
- **Step number**: Current position in sequence

### Cron Jobs

The automation system includes several cron jobs:

| Job | Schedule | Purpose |
|-----|----------|---------|
| `customersegmentation_process_emails` | Every 5 min | Process scheduled emails |
| `customersegmentation_refresh_segments` | Daily 5 AM | Refresh segment membership |
| `customersegmentation_cleanup_progress` | Daily 2 AM | Clean old progress records |
| `customersegmentation_cleanup_coupons` | Daily 3 AM | Remove expired unused coupons |
| `customersegmentation_automation_report` | Daily 4 AM | Generate performance stats |

### Logs

All automation activity is logged to `var/log/customer_segmentation.log`:

```
2025-10-21 05:35:00 INFO: Started email sequences for 1 customers entering segment 1
2025-10-21 05:35:00 INFO: Sent automation email to customer 3, template 1, queue 2
2025-10-21 05:35:00 INFO: Generated coupon CART3ABC123 for customer 3 using rule 1
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Segment Design

- **Be specific**: Narrow segments = more relevant emails
- **Test conditions**: Verify segment matches expected customers
- **Monitor size**: Track matched customer counts
- **Use website context**: Ensure segments work for specific websites

### 2. Email Timing

- **Start gentle**: First email should be informative, not salesy
- **Escalate gradually**: Increase incentives over time
- **Respect time zones**: Consider customer timezone (via store view)
- **Test sequences**: Run through the entire sequence yourself

### 3. Coupon Strategy

- **Progressive discounts**: Increase discount in later steps
- **Add scarcity**: Shorter expiration creates urgency
- **Track redemption**: Monitor which steps convert best
- **Set minimum order**: Use sales rule conditions to protect margins

### 4. Template Design

- **Mobile-first**: Most emails are read on mobile
- **Clear CTA**: One primary call-to-action per email
- **Test rendering**: Preview in multiple email clients
- **Include unsubscribe**: Respect customer preferences

### 5. Performance Optimization

- **Limit active sequences**: Don't overwhelm customers
- **Monitor bounce rates**: Clean invalid email addresses
- **A/B test**: Try different templates and timings
- **Regular cleanup**: Remove old progress records

## Sales Rule Configuration

For coupon generation to work, sales rules must be configured correctly:

1. **Coupon Type**: "Specific Coupon"
2. **Auto Generation**: Enabled
3. **Uses per Coupon**: Recommended 1 (one-time use)
4. **Uses per Customer**: Recommended 1
5. **Conditions**: Add any restrictions (minimum order amount, product categories, etc.)

Example sales rule for cart abandonment:
```
Name: Cart Abandonment 10%
Discount: 10% off entire cart
Minimum Cart Amount: $50
Coupon Type: Specific Coupon
Auto Generation: Yes
Uses per Coupon: 1
Uses per Customer: 1
```

## Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Sending

**Check these items**:

1. ✅ Customer is subscribed to newsletter
2. ✅ Segment "Auto Email Active" is enabled
3. ✅ Email sequence steps are active (`is_active = 1`)
4. ✅ Newsletter template exists and is valid
5. ✅ Cron is running (`customersegmentation_process_emails`)
6. ✅ Check `var/log/customer_segmentation.log` for errors

### Coupons Not Generating

**Check these items**:

1. ✅ Sales rule is active
2. ✅ Sales rule has "Auto Generation" enabled
3. ✅ Sales rule coupon type is "Specific Coupon"
4. ✅ Sequence step has `generate_coupon = 1`
5. ✅ Valid sales rule ID is configured
6. ✅ Check logs for generation errors

### Duplicate Sequences

**Possible causes**:

- Segment refreshing too frequently
- Customer re-entering segment
- Overlapping segment logic disabled

**Solutions**:

- Review segment refresh schedule
- Add conditions to prevent re-entry
- Check sequence progress before starting new ones

## Advanced Usage

### Exit Sequences

Trigger emails when customers **leave** a segment:

**Use case**: Customer exits "Active Cart" segment (purchased or cart expired)

```
Trigger: Exit Segment
Step 1 (immediate): "Thank you for your purchase!" (for purchasers)
Step 1 (immediate): "Item sold out" (for cart expirations)
```

### Conditional Templates

Use Maho's template directives for conditional content:

```html
{{depend customer.getGroupId() == 1}}
    <p>As a wholesale customer, you get extra benefits!</p>
{{/depend}}

{{if store.getId() == 2}}
    <p>Free shipping on this store!</p>
{{/if}}
```
