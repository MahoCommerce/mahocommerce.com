## ðŸš€ New features and major improvements

### [Replaced TinyMCE with TipTap](https://github.com/MahoCommerce/maho/pull/179) [3.0 with custom Maho plugins](https://github.com/MahoCommerce/maho/pull/230)

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22b0ceaa-3a02-4ae2-8d2b-cf0b13bb9e9e" width=400 align=right>

With TinyMCE changing its license to GPL (not compatible with OSL3), we decided to take the hard task to look for the best open source replacement and the king, today, is for sure [TipTap](https://tiptap.dev), its modern, well developed, supported and maintained and we fell in love with its API, which allowed use to develop **brand new plugins for widgets, variables, images** and much more, **this release introduces MahoSlideshow**, which is just the first step into building a full fledged **page builder**! It also provides a much stronger validation of the produced HTML, which, in the long run, will allow for much stronger safety of your store.

### [Added minimal layout for checkout (no header, no footer)](https://github.com/MahoCommerce/maho/pull/195)

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99da3d2b-923e-4dc5-93f3-af876a841eee" width=400 align=right>

One single flag (enabled by default) and the checkout experience of your store will be completely decluttered, like all major successful store are using nowadays, stripping away header and footer distractions to seriously boost your conversion rates.

<br clear=both>

### [Added "Dynamic Categories" feature: rule-based product assignment](https://github.com/MahoCommerce/maho/pull/200)

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc581bd1-a253-439c-b543-1349d740b0e3" width=400 align=right>

This release brings an **intelligent category management system that automatically assigns products to categories based on configurable rules**, saving you hours of manual work by letting products organize themselves into seasonal collections, price-based groupings, or whatever complex hierarchies you need.  
Need a **shop-by-brand navigation? This feature does it for you** with no need for commercial modules.

### [Added "payment restrictions" functionality](https://github.com/MahoCommerce/maho/pull/182)

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b4b0fd0-38aa-40f2-9918-fcc9e74b33aa" width=400 align=right>

There are times where you need to **restrict certain payment methods to a specific set of customers** (eg: cash-on-delivery only for returning buyers), our new **rule-based payment method restriction** system uses Maho's existing rule engine with the intuitive tree-like interface you already know, so you can set up sophisticated payment control based on customer location, order value, groups, or any combination you need for your business workflow.

<br clear=both>

### [Frontend: Implemented global offcanvas navigation and CSS-only tabs in product page](https://github.com/MahoCommerce/maho/pull/224)

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/962fc478-21e4-45bb-970a-9f36becc3b32" width=400 align=right>

Mobile navigation has been completely revolutionized with modern off-canvas, almost fully CSS based, with just a few lines of vanilla javascript code (to optimize the number of DOM elements). This PR also rewrites the tab-based section of products page with a CSS-only solution.

### [Added Admin Activity Log functionality](https://github.com/MahoCommerce/maho/pull/208)

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16a481e9-b789-477f-aece-4c02ce7e8af7" width=400 align=right>

We built a comprehensive **audit trail system that tracks all administrative actions** (and successful/failed logins), essential for compliance, knowing who did what and recover lost information (up to a certain degree).  
**All of the data is encrypted** and the unique **diff-like interface** is something else.

<br clear=both>

### [Added Media Library to CMS admin section](https://github.com/MahoCommerce/maho/pull/199)

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/916da429-256a-4842-bbe6-1c993e830262" width=400 align=right>

Before Maho 25.9 you could only access the media file manager from the rich-text editor, but now a new menu item in the `CMS` section will take you to the same file-manager view, for a quick and independent management of your files. But this is only the start for Maho of a full media editing experience which will come in the next releases so... stay tuned for this!

<br clear=both>

### [Added tier pricing support for configurable products](https://github.com/MahoCommerce/maho/pull/197)

Previously, tier pricing only considered individual variant quantities, now it's based on the total quantity across all variants of the same configurable product, like it should have been from the start.

### [Added admin interface for managing countries, regions, and their translations](https://github.com/MahoCommerce/maho/pull/180)

No more manually editing database tables when you need to add a new province/state to your project. With Maho 25.9 you have a **comprehensive CRUD interface for directory data management with full translation support**. This also removes the Zend_Locale dependency for regional settings.

### [Replaced session management with `symfony/http-foundation`](https://github.com/MahoCommerce/maho/pull/184)

Session handling has been completely ripped out and replaced with Symfony's rock-solid HTTP Foundation component, which **includes Redis support out-of-the-box** and improved security, removing the need for 3rd party modules.

### Replaced [Zend_Soap with Laminas_Soap](https://github.com/MahoCommerce/maho/pull/229), [Zend_Json with native json_encode/json_decode, Zend_Json_Server with Laminas_Json_Server](https://github.com/MahoCommerce/maho/pull/231) and [Zend_XmlRpc with Laminas_XmlRpc](https://github.com/MahoCommerce/maho/pull/235)

In the quest of providing the most lean and modern ecommerce platform we're removing old dependencies, migrating to new maintained and optimized ones, and making optional as many dependencies as possible, so that your installation will be smaller and safer in case you don't use those features!
