MahoCommerce 25.3.0 has arrived, putting security and modern convenience front and center with a host of
exciting updates designed to make your eCommerce platform safer, sleeker, and more powerful than ever!

<!-- more -->

## ðŸš€ New features and major improvements

### New header layout

Isn't this new layout amazing? **modern, compact, with new icons and new layout, responsive optimized**, you really don't need much more! Our goal is for our default theme to be really used by all stores that now rely on 3rd party commercial themes.

### Self-hosted GDPR compliant captcha module

This is a first in class for sure! At Maho we're all about privacy and GDPR (especially for European companies) is a must, but some services (and captcha is one of them) are always based on 3rd party platforms that gather data about your store and your customers. Not anymore, **we're the first platform to provide a self-hosted, cookieless, GDPR compliant captcha solution** based on the open-source project called [Altcha](https://altcha.org).

### Full SMTP support

Do you remember the time when you had to install a 3rd party module to have SMTP support? Not with Maho 25.3, **full SMTP support is now bundled in the core** (we re-created all the code from scratch for it to be as modern as it can get), technically it's based on the amazing `symfony/mailer` which allows you to **connect to a huge variety of services (SES, Azure, Mandrill, SendGrid and many more)** without the need for custom coding!

### Passkey authentication for backend

Backend security has been significantly enhanced with Maho 25.3! **Passkey passwordless authentication method leverages FIDO2 standards, providing phishing-resistant access to admin users through biometric verification or hardware security keys**. Which, **in addition to native 2-factor authentication** (which we added in 25.1) makes the backend of your store stronger than a safe in a bank!

### 5800+ icons library (thanks to Tabler) and Mage_Core_Block_Abstract::getIconSvg()

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fafe2bb8-0c07-4d3a-bdb5-1d349a4c1a63" width=400 align=right />

We want Maho to be the best ecommerce platform there is, and the graphic design system is one of the areas that we wanted to tackle, and we did it in the biggest possible way introducing a huge set of SVG icons, based on what we think it's the best, which is [Tabler icons](https://tabler.io/icons), and that you can add to your template thanks to the new `->getIconSvg()` method and that you can customize via CSS (color, size and stroke width!).

### Frontend: added `srcset 2x` to all templates

Did you ever think your magento-based project had kinda-blurry thumbnails for the past 15 years? Well, the world was waiting for Maho to solve it, **introducing `srcset`for retina displays** (at the moment only 2x, in order to avoid an uncontrolled growth of the image cache), a simple improvement that was much needed and that propels our frontend theme a step forward!

### Move products to a different attribute set + EAV scheme cleaning

If you worked with any of the Magento based platform you've seen this feature requested many many times. And we built it right into the core, in a simple yet effective way (which is our motto anyway). And after you change the attribute-set of a product, a scheduled routine will take care of cleaning all the orphaned records in the EAV tables (which, by the way, will make your store healthier anyway, especially if you had used custom import tools like Magmi). By the way, if you make a mistake, you'll have a few hours to revert the change back before the cleaning routines kick-in, better safe than sorry!
