## 🚀 New features and major improvements

### [Added `blog` module with admin interface, frontend, search and APIs integration](https://github.com/MahoCommerce/maho/pull/103)

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b79fd7dc-69ac-4a6d-a321-d16bfa2ff82f" width=400 align=right>

A feature long requested to allow store managers to publish news to their customers. No longer you need commercial modules or bridge modules for wordpress, you now have a simple but effective implementation, with **SEO friendly features**. We coded our blog based on the powerful and expandable **EAV system, so that you can customize the blog entity** as much as you want.

The **blog posts are also integrated in the search autosuggestion** (if you want to).

### [Added `Customer Segmentation` module with rule-based targeting](https://github.com/MahoCommerce/maho/pull/286)

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0235665-faa7-4952-b3c1-e30720049cfc" width=400 align=right>

This is an enterprise grade feature allows you to **group customers based on** a huge number of factors like **demographics, account data, order history, shopping behavior, product interactions, time-based conditions and even cart content!**

You'll then be able to **integrate a segment into shopping cart promotion rules and in newsletter sending** too!

<br clear=both>

### [Added image editing functionality to CMS Media Library](https://github.com/MahoCommerce/maho/pull/254)

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ab9db4d-7091-43d3-b082-b0dba21ed7c4" width=400 align=right>

Need to quickly crop a picture that's already uploaded to your ecommerce website? No need to download it, open an image editor etc, since Maho 25.9 includes a customized version of [FileRobot image editor](https://github.com/scaleflex/filerobot-image-editor) (show them love for this amazing tool), something that only much bigger and expensive platforms provide (until now).

This editor is tightly integrated with Maho, **automatically detecting image compression level and format**, and provides advanced features like watermark, text adding, image color editing, and more!

<br clear=both>

### [Replaced `Zend_Pdf` with `DomPdf`](https://github.com/MahoCommerce/maho/pull/223)

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/954632f7-3137-4c6c-b97a-1a4ba4a6b079" width=400 align=right>

Generating PDFs for invoices and other documents was a major pain point of the M1 platform, so we thought enough was enough, we rebuilt the whole functionality from scratch **bringing the power of `phtml` inheritance and customizability to PDFs** too.

Thanks to [DomPdf](https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf) and our great frawork we can now **create PDF templates as if they were normal web pages**, and the system will take care of the conversion to PDF.

<br clear=both>

### [Replaced `Zend_Log` with `monolog`](https://github.com/MahoCommerce/maho/pull/276)

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/162ebe3e-b663-4ad0-822c-60433bf1677e" width=400 align=right>

Developers need a more powerful logging/reporting capability and there's nothing better than monolog in the PHP world.

By default Maho will now use 𝗹𝗼𝗴 𝗿𝗼𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻, huge system.log files are finally in the rear mirror, but most of all you'll be able to 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗳𝗶𝗴𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗺𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝗹𝗼𝗴 𝗮𝗱𝗮𝗽𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝘃𝗶𝗮 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗳𝗶𝗴 𝗫𝗠𝗟 and this is an immense benefit, why you ask?

Now you'll be able to have the default log file (with rotation) for all your normal logging need, and (for example) 𝗽𝗼𝘀𝘁 𝗮 𝗹𝗼𝗴 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝙎𝗹𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗹 when the severity requires it, or even 𝘁𝗼 𝗮 𝗧𝗲𝗹𝗲𝗴𝗿𝗮𝗺 𝗯𝗼𝘁 for immediate alert of some specific people in your company!

### Improved guest-orders management

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/229cb8e0-c911-43d9-a8be-8ad57c19cb36" width=400 align=right>

-  [Added "Missing order?" feature for guest order association to existing customer](https://github.com/MahoCommerce/maho/pull/280)
- [Added ability to edit guest order email addresses from admin panel](https://github.com/MahoCommerce/maho/pull/290)

<br clear=both>

### [Added `Speculation Rules API` module](https://github.com/MahoCommerce/maho/pull/277)

The [Speculation Rules API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Speculation_Rules_API) lets you set smart rules for when the browser should prefetch or prerender pages by watching things like where the user is hovering, all with minimal effort but big rewards in speed and usability. In addition to support for BFcache (that we added previously) Maho now allows you to easily configure a set of CSS-style rules (targeting links on every web page) for every rendering mode and eagerness mode. And the best thing is that it's enabled by default (in conservative settings).

### [Added category search to autosuggest dropdown](https://github.com/MahoCommerce/maho/pull/291)

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a4bba56-9054-4f83-af4b-21a2d6c5d534" width=400 align=right>

In the past couple of releases we worked a lot on improving the built-in autosuggest functionality, in 25.9 we adding support for searching and autocompleting category names. The feature is completely configurable and it has fulltext support too.

<br clear=both>

### [Added `region import` functionality to admin interface](https://github.com/MahoCommerce/maho/pull/294)

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b866220f-7528-46cd-9cae-93c83c4be67b" width=400 align=right>

Localization is a primary effort for Maho and we want a frictionless implementation, that's why we created the [Maho Directory Data project](https://github.com/MahoCommerce/directory-data) and added a super easy import of states/provinces (automatically translated in every langauge) into your store's database. This comes in addition to the possibility of manually adding/editing/remove/translate single entries (introduced in Maho 25.7.0).

This functionality also comes with its own [CLI commands](https://github.com/MahoCommerce/maho/pull/289) for terminal people.

<br clear=both>

### [Added built-in CSS/JS minification and 103 Early Hints support](https://github.com/MahoCommerce/maho/pull/250)

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8009d9c4-2bbb-4efc-8a1f-a52cbf963471" width=400 align=right>

We already had a great extension for CSS/JS minification but we wanted to have native [103 Early Hints](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/103) support in the core so we decided to refactor that extension to integrate it in the best way possible, and now we've the benefit (on supported web servers like [FrankenPHP](https://frankenphp.dev)) for early hits for even better performance.

<br clear=both>

### [Added category import/export](https://github.com/MahoCommerce/maho/pull/302)

Traditionally the M1 platform could only import/export products and customers. We're want to fill the gap here starting with categories, now natively available via the `System -> Import / Export` section of the backend, and more feature will come in the near future.

### [Removed `flatpickr` and migrated to native input type `date, time, datetime-local`](https://github.com/MahoCommerce/maho/pull/255)

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04e306b6-d85f-4913-bbb2-6f4497c1a865" width=250 align=right>

Javascript datetime pickers are a whole world but in 2025 we believe there's no need for those anymore, browser [support for native (and mobile native) date and time selectors is now so widespread](https://caniuse.com/?search=input%20type%20date) that it was time for us to migrate away from javascript solutions. This has a lot of benefits: no js/css means faster rendering, automatically localized based on your browser locale, simpler protocols since the browser always submits the dates in ISO format regardless of the locale.
