# Third week of development

A quick holiday update from the development team.

<!-- more -->

This week the work was mainly focused on:

- Adding to our CLI tool as many commands as possible
- Fixing the web installer
- Making a completely new cron system
- Bringing the CLI installer into our own CLI tool
- Removing old features and cleaning up leftover files
- Rewriting our new autoloaders in order for them to be more portable and easier on PHPStan
- Making all the workflows run and green again and simplify them as much as possible
- Writing documentation on the website

That's all for now, be sure to join the newsletter and community!  
Maho rocks! ðŸš€
