## 🚀 New features and major improvements

### Multi-Database Support

Maho now operates across **three database engines: MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite**. This advancement leverages Doctrine DBAL 4.4 to provide true database flexibility. PostgreSQL enables enterprise deployments with its advanced features, while SQLite supports lightweight installations perfect for development, testing, or small deployments.

Our demo store running on SQLite demonstrates **performance improvements of nearly 50% faster reindexing** compared to MySQL, showing that the right database choice can make a significant difference for your specific use case.

### Magic Link Authentication

We're introducing **passwordless authentication via secure email links**, giving your customers a modern, frictionless login experience. The system supports two modes:

- **Hybrid mode**: Traditional passwords alongside optional magic link access
- **Passwordless mode**: Email-only login with password fields completely hidden

Security is paramount: the system uses **32-character cryptographically secure tokens**, configurable expiration (10 minutes default), and rate limiting that prevents email enumeration attacks.

### Gift Card Module

A comprehensive gift card system is now built into Maho's core. Features include:

- **Fixed or custom amounts** for flexible gifting options
- **Partial payment application** with automatic balance tracking
- **PDF export** with QR codes and barcodes
- **Recipient notifications** via email
- **Refund handling** that credits balances back to cards

This enterprise-grade feature required no third-party modules and integrates seamlessly with Maho's checkout and order management.

### CatalogLinkRule Module

**Automate your product relationships** through condition-based rules instead of manual assignment. Define source and target conditions, customize sort ordering, and let the daily cron process handle everything in efficient 100-product batches. Perfect for "customers also bought", related products, or any automated cross-sell strategy.

### USPS REST API Migration

We've replaced the legacy XML API with the **modern USPS REST API** featuring OAuth 2.0 support. This update introduces **shipping label generation capability** and reduces API requests by approximately 90%, making shipping calculations faster and more reliable.

### Enhanced Dashboard Analytics

Get **server-side visitor insights** directly in your admin dashboard without relying on third-party analytics services. Features include:

- 30-day visitor trends
- Device and browser breakdowns
- Conversion rate tracking
- Entry and exit page analysis
- Traffic source referrers
- Language preferences

All data stays on your server with zero third-party data collection.
