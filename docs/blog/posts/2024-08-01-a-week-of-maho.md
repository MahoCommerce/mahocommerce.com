# A week of Maho

Today it's a week since Maho was born, and it marks significant progress in the development.
I want to share an overview of our recent activities and upcoming plans.

<!-- more -->

## Recent revelopments

We worked on several minor buy key areas:
- Website development and implementation of an automatic publishing toolchain
- Configuration of automatic phpDoc generation on each push to the main repository
- A few cleanup commits on Maho's main branch (further details will be provided in the first release)
- Structuring of GitHub organization, repositories, and evaluation of roadmap templates

## Ongoing major projects

In addition to these accomplishments, we are currently engaged in two substantial projects:

1. **New CLI Tool**: Development of a command-line interface tool comparable to Laravel's Artisan.
2. **File Structure Innovation**: We are working on a project that will introduce a new approach to file structure in 
   the M1 platform. While specifics are not yet ready for public disclosure, we anticipate this development to 
   significantly impact project organization. We estimate approximately two more weeks of development 
   before we can provide more comprehensive information.

## Looking Ahead

We continue to work hard and look forward to presenting our progress in the coming weeks, thank you for your interest
in this project!

Maho rocks! ðŸš€
