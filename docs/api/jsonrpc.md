# JSON-RPC API

Maho supports JSON-RPC API endpoints that follow the same patterns and functionality as documented in OpenMage.

For detailed information on using the JSON-RPC API, please refer to the [OpenMage JSON-RPC documentation](https://docs.openmage.org/api/jsonrpc).

The API endpoints, method signatures, and response formats remain consistent between Maho and OpenMage, ensuring compatibility for existing integrations.
