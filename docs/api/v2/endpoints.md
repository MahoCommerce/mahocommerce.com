# REST Endpoints <span class="version-badge">v26.7+</span>

This page is the **REST v2** reference. The same resources are available over GraphQL - for the query and mutation field names, arguments, and examples, see the [GraphQL reference](graphql.md).

All paths below are relative to the **`/api/rest/v2`** prefix: `GET /products` means `GET https://your-domain.com/api/rest/v2/products`.

| DELETE | `/carts/{id}/items/{itemId}/gift-message` | Customer/Admin/API | Remove a per-item gift message |

The checkout sub-resources mirror the guest-cart flow so a logged-in customer can complete checkout entirely over REST. Gift messages require the `sales/gift_options/*` store config to be enabled; the body is `{sender, recipient, message}`. There is no separate gift-message resource - it is a sub-resource of the cart (`/carts/{id}/gift-message`).

---

### Orders

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/orders` | Admin/API | List orders (paginated) |
| GET | `/orders/{id}` | Customer/Admin/API | Get order by ID (customers see only their own) |
| GET | `/orders/{incrementId}/details` | Order token | Read a guest order via the per-order one-time `X-Order-Token` header |
| POST | `/orders` | None | Place an order from a customer or guest cart |
| POST | `/carts/{id}/place-order` | Customer/Admin/API | Place an order from the authenticated customer cart |
| POST | `/guest-carts/{id}/place-order` | None | Place an order from a guest cart |

**Checkout addresses:** the `shippingAddress` / `billingAddress` objects in the place-order body accept either a numeric `regionId` **or** a region `region` name - for countries with a fixed region list (US, CA, ...) the API resolves the `region_id` from the code (or name) against `countryId` when `regionId` is omitted, so a client can send `"region": "California"` without looking the ID up first. On a match the returned address carries the canonical region name.

**Guest order lookup** (`GET /orders/{incrementId}/details`): a public, unauthenticated endpoint for rendering order-confirmation views in headless/guest checkouts. The per-order token is passed in the `X-Order-Token` header (never the query string, which would leak into access logs). The token is **single-use**: it's cleared on the first successful read, so refreshing the page won't replay the lookup. The endpoint is IP rate-limited to prevent brute-forcing a token against a known increment ID. A missing/invalid token or unknown increment ID returns `404`. If no customer account exists for the order's email, the response includes an `accountToken` the frontend can use with `POST /customers/create-from-order`.

```bash
curl /api/rest/v2/orders/100000123/details \
  -H 'X-Order-Token: <one-time-token>'
```

**Order sub-resources:**

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |

| POST | `/orders/{orderId}/shipments` | Admin/API | Create shipment |
| GET | `/orders/{orderId}/credit-memos` | Admin/API | List credit memos for order |
| POST | `/orders/{orderId}/credit-memos` | Admin/API | Create credit memo/refund |
| GET | `/orders/{orderId}/invoices` | Customer/Admin/API | List invoices for order |
| GET | `/orders/{orderId}/invoices/{id}/pdf` | Customer/Admin/API | Download invoice PDF |

**Customer invoice access:**

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/customers/me/orders/{orderId}/invoices` | Customer/API | List own invoices |
| GET | `/customers/me/orders/{orderId}/invoices/{id}/pdf` | Customer/API | Download own invoice PDF |

**Lifecycle actions:** each returns the updated order (the `statusHistory` field reflects the change).

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/orders/{id}/hold` | Admin/API | Put an order on hold |
| POST | `/orders/{id}/unhold` | Admin/API | Release an order from hold |
| POST | `/orders/{id}/cancel` | Customer/Admin/API | Cancel an order (a customer may cancel their own) |

|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/shipments/{id}` | Admin/API | Get shipment by ID |
| POST | `/shipments/{id}/tracks` | Admin/API | Add a tracking number (`{carrierCode?, title?, trackNumber}`) |
| DELETE | `/shipments/{id}/tracks/{trackId}` | Admin/API | Remove a tracking number by its track row ID |

`{trackId}` is the internal track row ID (an integer), **not** the carrier tracking number.

**Create shipment:**
```bash
curl -X POST /api/rest/v2/orders/123/shipments \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJ...' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "items": [{"orderItemId": 456, "qty": 2}],
    "tracks": [{"carrierCode": "auspost", "title": "Australia Post", "trackNumber": "AP123456"}],
    "comment": "Shipped via express",
    "notifyCustomer": true
  }'
```

Omit `items` to ship every remaining item on the order. Each track entry needs at least `trackNumber`; `carrierCode` defaults to `custom` and `title` defaults to the carrier code.

### Revocation (EU)

Contract revocation declarations under EU Directive 2023/2673 (the "revocation button"). The API exposes the **authenticated** channel: a logged-in customer revokes one of their own orders, and admins list and process the declarations. The public, unauthenticated web form remains at `/revocation` and is not part of the API.

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/customers/me/revocation-requests` | Customer/API | Submit a revocation against your own order |
| GET | `/customers/me/revocation-requests` | Customer/API | List your own declarations |
| GET | `/revocation-requests` | Admin/API | List all declarations |
| GET | `/revocation-requests/{id}` | Customer/Admin/API | Get one declaration (own request for customers, any for admins) |
| PUT | `/revocation-requests/{id}` | Admin/API | Set the processing status and internal note |

**Submit body:**
```bash
curl -X POST /api/rest/v2/customers/me/revocation-requests \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <customer_jwt>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"orderId": 1234, "reason": "I changed my mind"}'
```
- `orderId` (int) or `orderReference` (order increment ID) identifies the order; one is required.
- Ownership is re-checked server-side: an order that isn't the authenticated customer's returns `404`.
- Because the customer is authenticated and owns the order, the recorded declaration is **verified** (`verified: true`), the same trust level as the my-account web link. The declaration row is the legal receipt and is always written, even if the receipt/notification emails are suppressed.
- The submission is gated by the store's cooling-off window; an order past it returns `422`.
- Disabled revocation (`revocation/general/enabled = 0`) returns `404`.

**Response fields:** `id`, `orderId`, `orderReference`, `reason`, `customerName`, `email`, `verified`, `storeId`, `receivedAt`, `processedStatus`, `processedAt`, `suppressedAt`, `suppressedReason`. The internal-only fields `adminNote`, `ip`, and `userAgent` are returned **only** to admins.

**Admin processing:**
```bash
curl -X PUT /api/rest/v2/revocation-requests/1234 \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <admin_jwt>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"processedStatus": "accepted", "adminNote": "Refund issued"}'
```
- `processedStatus` must be one of `accepted`, `rejected`, `info_requested`; anything else returns `422`. Setting it stamps `processedAt`.

### Newsletter

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/newsletter/subscribe` | None | Subscribe to newsletter (gated by `newsletter/subscription/allow_guest_subscribe`) |
| POST | `/newsletter/unsubscribe` | None | Unsubscribe by email |
| GET | `/newsletter/status` | Customer/API | Get subscription status |

**Guest subscription control:** Guest (unauthenticated) subscribe is controlled by the Maho config flag `newsletter/subscription/allow_guest_subscribe` (**System > Config > Newsletter > Subscription Options > Allow Guest Subscription**). When disabled, only authenticated customers can subscribe. Recommended: set to **No** for API use to prevent abuse.

**Confirmation emails:** When `newsletter/subscription/confirm` is enabled, new subscriptions receive a confirmation email and remain inactive until confirmed (double opt-in).

### Contact

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/contact` | None | Submit contact form |
| GET | `/contact/config` | None | Get contact form config |

`GET /contact/config` response example:

```json
{
  "id": "contact",
  "enabled": true,
  "captchaProvider": "turnstile",
  "captchaSiteKey": "0x4AAA...",
  "honeypotField": "_h_a4b2c1d3"
}
```

`captchaProvider` is one of `none`, `turnstile`, `recaptcha_v3` (or anything an installed third-party module registers). `captchaSiteKey` is `null` when the provider is `none`. Frontends use these two fields to load the matching widget client-side; for richer per-provider config the helper-based event flow described under [CAPTCHA](captcha.md) is used instead.

The `honeypotField` value is **deterministic per install** (derived from the encryption key) and **opaque** to the frontend, render it as a hidden input and don't expose its value, e.g. `<input type="text" name="{honeypotField}" style="display:none" tabindex="-1" autocomplete="off" />`. If a request body arrives with a non-empty value in that field, the API silently treats it as spam (returns success without sending the email). When honeypot is disabled in admin, `honeypotField` is `null` and the frontend can skip it.
