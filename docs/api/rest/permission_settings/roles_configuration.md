REST roles in Magento are used to limit access to certain resources. Limiting access lies in configuration of a REST role and assigning a user to it. You can select which resources will be available for the user and which will not.

REST roles management consists in the role creation, editing, deleting, and user assignment. Note that REST role creation and deletion is available only for Admin role.

The REST Roles page initially includes two roles: Customer and Guest.

Only API Resources can be edited in the Guest and Customer roles. You cannot change the name or assigned users in these roles. Also, you cannot delete the Guest or Customer role.
