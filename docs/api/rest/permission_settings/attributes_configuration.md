REST attributes allow specifying additional filters for different types of users. Attributes allow limiting user access more precisely.

## REST Attributes Structure

The REST attributes tree includes the following elements (as subnodes):

-   Name of the resource
    -   Read permissions (includes all elements available for the current resource)
    -   Write permissions (includes all elements available for the current resource)

The Resources tree may be too immense. To avoid scrolling down when searching for the required resource, you can fold the nodes for better representation.

## Managing Attributes for Guest
